    <header><h2>Neil Gaiman</h2></header>
    <section>I mean, no comic list is complete without Neil Gaiman making everyone else look terrible.  Sandman was beautifully disturbing, wrapping the warmth of a Dream with the horror of a nightmare.  </section>

     <h3>“People think dreams aren't real just because they aren't made of matter, of particles. Dreams are real. But they are made of viewpoints, of images, of memories and puns and lost hopes.”</h3>

    <header><h2>Alan Moore</h2></header>
    <section>Alan Moore was arguably more influential than any other writer in the 80's and 90's.  I mean, have you read "WATCHMEN"?  That is pretty great.</section>

<h3>"Once you realize what a joke everything is, being the Comedian is the only thing that makes sense."</h3>

    <header><h2>Robert Kirkman</h2></header>
    <section>I do not like Walking Dead.  The television show usually puts me to sleep, which may say more about me than it does the show.  However, the comic is pretty good.  Invincible, his take on superheros, is probably one of the more delightful things I have read in a long time.</section>

<h3>"This is being a Super-Hero? I'm just stopping crap from happening at any given moment. I'm not doing anything really worthwhile... ...and when I fail... my God, I fail big. We have the power to change the world, Eve... ...but instead things just keep getting worse."</h3>

    <header><h2>Matt Fraction</h2></header>
    <section>Even his name is badass and his writing is spot on.  His take on Hawkeye (on his days off when he isn't saving the world with the Avengers) is so good, I could write an entire blog post on it.  I won't.  Just a paragraph.  Just know, his life is our life.</section>

    <header><h2>Jonathan Hickman</h2></header>
    <section>Did you read any Fantastic Four ever?  Me neither.  It was one of those books that had relevance because of what it <em>was</em> but not for what it <em>is</em>.  He changed by changing Fantastic for to FF and killing off one of the "Family".  I would read this again. </section>

    <h3>This was the world that I had created. I know what I have to do to fix it...to make things right. There's no problem that can't be solved.</h3>
